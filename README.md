# Tantares IVA Expansion

A small expansion mod for Kerbal Space Program 1.12.x that adds realistic internal views (IVA) to the Soyuz, Progress, and some Mir/ISS modules from the popular [Tantares](https://github.com/Tantares/Tantares) mod.

> After years without any custom IVAs for Tantares, I decided to create and share my own.

## Features

- Realistic, Reviva-switchable IVAs for Soyuz (T, TM, TMA, M, MS)
- IVA for Soyuz LOK (Virgo)
- Station module IVAs loosely inspired by real interiors
- Full support for RPM and MAS
- Compatible with FreeIVA
